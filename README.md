# gdax-tradebot

Experimental GDAX (https://www.gdax.com) trading bot.

# Getting Started

These instructions allow you to get running and customise the project.

### Prerequisites

You will need a GDAX account and an API key. Create a config file (config.py) in the root directory with the following format:

```
API_KEY = ""
API_SECRET = ""
API_PASS = ""

USE_SANDBOX = 0     # 0 for gdax live environment; 1 for use the sandbox environment (Make sure to use sandbox keys!)
TEST_MODE = 1       # 0 for actual trading against the exchange; 1 for test mode (no trading!)
USE_TEST_PRICES = 1 # 0 to get prices from gdax, 1 to use test prices

# Configure which currencies you want to use
# Possible values for gdax 'BTC-EUR', 'ETH-EUR', 'LTC-EUR'
PRODUCT_IDS = ['BTC-EUR']

# Select which indicators you want to use
# Possible values 'EMA', 'DMI', 'MACD', 'RSI'
INDICATORS = ['EMA', 'MACD']

# Enable/Disable plotting the candles and indicators
# 0: disable plotting
# 1: enable plotting (Only enable it when you are debugging your algorithm)
PLOT = 1

CANDLE_TIME = 3600  # Seconds for accumulating in 1 candlestick
ORDER_TIMEOUT = 900 # Seconds after which an (not filled) order is canceled automatically

# Set the amount (%) of the balance you want to trade. 1 means everything; a value between 0 and 1 is valid
BALANCE_FOR_TRADING = 1

# Set the price offset you want to use for buying/selling. (Value between 0 and 1)
# When set to 0.02 selling will be done 2% above price of the moment of the order
# and 2% below the price of the moment of the order
TRADE_PRICE_OFFSET = 0.02

# Test variables (only used when TEST_MODE == 1)
BALANCES = {'BTC': 0.00, 'EUR': 200, 'ETH': 0.00, 'LTC': 0.00}
```

The project was built and tested with Python 3.6.5. To install the required packages, run the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Only needed when you want to plot
pip install https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl_finance/archive/master.zip
```

To run an example set TEST_MODE = 1 and USE_TEST_PRICES = 1 and run
```
python -u example.py
```
